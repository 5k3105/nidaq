binding using cgogen : https://github.com/xlab/cgogen

Works great for the functions I use:

SelfTestDevice
CreateTask
CreateAIThrmcplChan
StartTask
ReadAnalogF64
StopTask


Please refer to https://github.com/xlab/c-for-go/issues/11 for explanations of how this was generated.

Thank you to xlab and cznic for all the help :)
